# German Noun Gender Practice App
This React app is designed to help users practice and memorize the gender of German nouns. It allows users to view a list of German nouns with their corresponding articles (der, die, das), mark their favorites for focused practice, and add new words to the list.

The app lets you go through each noun one by one, but you can also click on any noun in the list to start from there.
It'll pick up right from the noun you chose.

To favorite a noun, just hover over it in the list on the right side and click on the heart icon.
You will also see options to edit or delete it.

If you get an answer right, the noun will turn green; if it's wrong, it'll turn red. These color cues also appear in your favorites list.

If your guess is incorrect, the right answer shows up in red below the "Continue" button.

Clicking on a word in your favorites list will focus the practice on those words only.

Using the search bar will show you results from both the complete list and your favorites.
